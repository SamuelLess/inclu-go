Whether you use a wheelchair, a prosthetic, have visual impairments, 
or prefer to avoid crowded spaces — we prioritize accessibility for you.
Because **every disability is unique** to you.

With our novel machine learning algorithm, we can present you with your own unique route planning you deserve.

## What we offer already 🌟
- **Personalised route planning** that helps you avoid inconvenient obstacles
- A simple **"tinder-like" introduction** that quickly gives you accurate results based on real-life statistics and your preferences
- A simple interface that helps you to continuously personalize your experience with each day

## What we plan to implement 🔮
- Adding obstacles with a **personalised barrier severity**
- A **profile and settings tab**
- A **funding feature** to get rid of the obstacles in the future
- A separate **web interface** for public facilities to see which obstacles have the highest overall barrier severity and should be fixed as soon as possible
