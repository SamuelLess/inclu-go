**Your journey. Your way.**

Whether you use a wheelchair, a prosthetic, have visual impairments, 
or prefer to avoid crowded spaces — we prioritize accessibility for you.

With our novel machine learning algorithm we can present you with your own unique route planning you deserve.

## What we offer already
- Personalised route planning that helps you avoid inconvenient obstacles
- A simple "tinder-like" introduction that quickly gives you accurate results based on real life statistics and your preferences
- A simple interface that helps you to continuously personalize your experience with each day

## What we plan to implement
- Adding obstacles with a personalised barrier severity
- A profile and settings tab
- A funding feature to get rid of the obstacles in the future
- A seperate webinterface for public facilities to see which obstacles have the highest overall barrier severity and should be fixed as soon as possible
